## 🔧 How the Project Was Developed

1. **Project Goal & Dataset**  
   - Analyzed a dataset of top 100 IMDb movies from the past 10 years.  
   - Explored movie features such as genre, runtime, IMDb rating, actor popularity, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
   - Removed duplicates, handled null values, and standardized columns.  
   - Transformed columns for multi-value fields (e.g., multiple genres or actors).

3. **Visualization & Analysis**  
   - Used Python libraries to create bar plots, heatmaps, pie charts, and trend lines.  
   - Explored questions like: Which genres are most popular? Who are the most frequent actors? How do ratings vary by runtime?  
   - **Visualizations include:**
     - Genre distribution bar chart  
     - Heatmap of correlation between movie features  
     - Actor frequency word cloud  
     - Runtime vs. rating scatter plot
